Banker's algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm. 
Whenever a new process is created, it must exactly specify the maximum instances of each resource type that it needs. 

The various data structures used in it are:
    Available: It is an array of length m. It represents the number of available resources of each type. 
    Allocation: It is an n x m matrix which represents the number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.
    Need: It is an n x m matrix which indicates the remaining resource needs of each process.
